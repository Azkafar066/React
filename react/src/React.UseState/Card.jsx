        <p>Description.</p>
        <p>When adidas designed the Real Madrid home kit, they looked to the long-standing traditions of the club’s famous city. Inspired by the “Chulapo” outfit worn at the San Isidro Fiesta, the houndstooth pattern on this authentic football jersey is a stylish addition. Featuring ventilated HEAT.RDY and a heat-applied club badge, this top is designed to be worn on the pitch. It’s made from 100% recycled materials. By reusing materials we help reduce waste and our reliance on finite resources, and reduce the carbon footprint of the products we make.
